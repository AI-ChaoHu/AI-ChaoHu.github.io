          <h5 class="article-title">
            Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a 3rd-year PhD student at Monash University, supervised by Asst. Prof. Bohan Zhuang and Prof. Jianfei Cai. I am a member of ZIP Lab. My research focuses on network compression and model efficiency. Here is my CV.
            I am actively looking for internships in 2023 (3-6 months). Please feel free to contact me via email.
