Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a 3rd-year PhD student at Monash University, supervised by Asst. Prof. Bohan Zhuang and Prof. Jianfei Cai. I am a member of ZIP Lab. My research focuses on network compression and model efficiency. Here is my CV.
An inline math: \\\(E=mc^2\\\).

A display math:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \Psi
$$
